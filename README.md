# Read With Me Annual Report

Welcome to the 2025 annual report for **Read With Me**, a volunteer-powered literacy program rooted in the Coachella Valley. This project reimagines traditional reporting as a scrollable, animated HTML experience—accessible, poetic, and technician-proof.

## 🌟 What Is This?

This is a visual storytelling experiment:  
- A single-page HTML scroll featuring impact stats, community stories, and a regional map  
- Designed for embedding on Google Sites or hosting via GitHub Pages  
- Includes decorative icons and logos that float gently between sections

## 🧩 Files Included

- `index.html` — the main scroll layout  
- `p1.png` to `p4.png` — report pages  
- `map.png` — regional impact map  
- `logo1.png`, `logo2.png` — program branding  
- `1.png` to `8.png` — decorative elements (books, badges, sunbursts)

## 🚀 How to View
